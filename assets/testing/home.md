### Notes:
1. **Dark Mode Testing**: Ensure that the charts and sections adjust well to the color scheme when dark mode is enabled.
2. **Responsiveness**: Test on multiple devices, such as mobile (small screens), tablet (medium screens), and desktop (large screens), to ensure the layout is fully responsive.
3. **Chart Rendering**: Verify that the data in charts is rendered correctly and reflects the correct spending data.
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with scenarios like:
   - No budget set (ensure the budget section hides).
   - No spending recorded for the day or last 7 days (ensure the charts handle empty data gracefully).
   - Extremely large or small values for expenses and budgets (test edge cases).
